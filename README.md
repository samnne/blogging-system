# Blogging System.
An admin dashboard for a blogging system application built with PyQT6.

The application was built using the data access objects (DAO) pattern to separate technical implementation from business overview.  
The application allows you to create, delete, and update blogs and posts separately which is securely tested with the unittest framework.

# Tech Stack

- Built with **Python v3.9**
- Tested with **Unittest**
- Dashboard and GUI built with **PyQt6**

```bash
pip install PyQt6
git clone https://github.com/samnne/blogging-system.git
cd blogging-system
python3 -m blogging gui
```
